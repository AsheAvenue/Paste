* This app was based on RethinkDB's Ruby sample app: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb-example-sinatra-pastie
* That sample app was inspired by Nick Plante's [toopaste](https://github.com/zapnap/toopaste) project.
* The snippets of code used for syntax highlighting are from Ryan Tomayko's [rocco.rb](https://github.com/rtomayko/rocco) project.
* Code highlighting in snippets is done using [Pygments](http://pygments.org) or the [Pygments web service](http://pygments.appspot.com/)
* The [Solarized dark Pygments stylesheet](https://gist.github.com/1573884) was created by Zameer Manji
